The {gtreg} package creates tabular data summaries appropriate for regulatory submissions.
The package builds the tables using {gtsummary}.

A common use-case handled by {gtreg} is the counting of adverse events (AEs).
In this setting, the programmer's task is to tabulate adverse events by any or all of:
AE term, system organ class, grade, and treatment arm. 
AE tables are most often provided to programmers in a flat file that contains multiple
rows per patient; i.e. one row per AE.
Some challenges with this structure are that study participants who have no AEs do 
not appear in the AE table, and individual participants may have several of the 
same AE (possibly with different severity grades).
Both of these features pose difficulties with regards to calculating proportions;
e.g. the percentage of participants in a treatment arm who experience a specific AE.
In the numerator, we need to make sure that we do not double count the same AE within
each participant, and in the denominator we need to make sure we include all patients 
in the treatment arm (not just those who experience an AE). 
These challenges are amplified when AE terms need to roll up into system organ class
summaries.
Functions in {gtreg} address these problems (among others) by implementing industry
recommended approaches. 
For further reading, the PHUSE white paper regarding
[Analysis and Displays Associated with Adverse events](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Deliverables/Standard+Analyses+and+Code+Sharing/Analyses+and+Displays+Associated+with+Adverse+Events+Focus+on+Adverse+Events+in+Phase+2-4+Clinical+Trials+and+Integrated+Summary.pdf)
provides an excellent summary of such standards.

## Installation

You can install the development version of {gtreg} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shannonpileggi/gtreg")
```

## Example

Summarize Adverse Events by Grade.
The denominators in the table are the number of patients in the study.

```{r example}
library(gtreg)
gtsummary::theme_gtsummary_compact()

tbl_ae <- 
  df_adverse_events %>%
  tbl_ae(
    id_df = df_patient_characteristics,
    id = patient_id,
    ae = adverse_event,
    soc = system_organ_class, 
    by = grade, 
    strata = trt
  ) %>%
  modify_ae_header(all_ae_cols() ~ "**Grade {by}**") %>% 
  bold_labels()
```

```{r example-tbl_ae, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl_ae), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
# Have to do this workaround since the README needs markdown format for GitHub page but a different format for the website.
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  as_gt(tbl)
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example-tbl_ae-1.png")
} 
```

Summarize Raw Adverse Counts

```{r example2}
tbl_ae_count <- 
  df_adverse_events %>%
  tbl_ae_count(
    ae = adverse_event,
    soc = system_organ_class, 
    by = drug_attribution
  ) %>%
  add_overall(across = "by") %>%
  modify_ae_spanning_header(all_ae_cols() ~ "**Drug Attribution**") %>%
  bold_labels()
```

```{r example-tbl_ae_count, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl_ae_count), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp2.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "76%", echo = FALSE}
# Have to do this workaround since the README needs markdown format for GitHub page but a different format for the website.
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  as_gt(tbl)
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example-tbl_ae_count-1.png")
} 
```

Focus on rates of high grade complications with `tbl_ae_focus()`

```{r example3}
tbl_ae_focus <- 
  df_adverse_events %>%
  tbl_ae_focus(
    id_df = df_patient_characteristics,
    id = patient_id,
    ae = adverse_event,
    include = c(any_complication, grade3_complication)
  )
```

```{r example-tbl_ae_focus, include = FALSE}
# Had to manually save images in temp file, not sure if better way.
gt::gtsave(as_gt(tbl_ae_focus), file = file.path(tempdir(), "temp3.png"))
```

```{r out.width = "62%", echo = FALSE}
# Have to do this workaround since the README needs markdown format for GitHub page but a different format for the website.
if (identical(Sys.getenv("IN_PKGDOWN"), "true")) {
  as_gt(tbl)
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("man/figures/README-example-tbl_ae_focus-1.png")
} 
```
